# game-review

game-review is a personal collection of game reviews and nothing more.

## Motive

* Writing more: since I graduated from Concordia University, I haven't written much besides technical writing, and since English is not my mother language, I have the feeling that my writing skills are atrophying.
* Get better at Vim motions AND get used to my ZSA Moonlander V1 at the same time: This is like riding a bike that you are used to, but instead of standard pedals we are using clips, and removing the front wheel. Only one way forward: train more.
* Play video games at their completion: As life goes on, my free time seems to get shorter and it is easy to spend it on "fast food" video games. I hope that adding a goal to complete interesting games will help me... complete them.

## Disclaimer

All reviews will be my personal opinion. They might change over time.
