## One word: chore

Let me start by saying that I was excited about this game. Back in 2010, Limbo was a breath of fresh air and the minimalist in me had a blast. But we are not talking about Limbo here, and it is not 2010 anymore.

Cocoon is visually interesting. The art design has a perfect blend of organic organic-looking world mixed with technologically advanced machinery. Everything feels very polished to the eye, and we can tell it was a very important process of the game's development. The soundtrack complements the atmosphere well too. Sadly, this is where most of the good stops. 

As a puzzle game, I found Cocoon to be very disappointing. Uninteresting. At some point in the game, I did not even consider this game a puzzle game. It was more about managing orbs than solving puzzles. And just to be clear, I don't think I am particularly good at solving complex puzzles. They just felt more about moving the orbs around than anything else. I often look at the estimated time to complete a game on HowLongToBeat.com, and if this game had not been estimated at around five hours, I would not have finished this game. Around the 86% completion mark, you start moving between the worlds... I would have loved this mechanic to have this mechanic earlier in the game since I thought it played a more major role in the puzzle design.

It led me to a question: was that game really about being a puzzle game? Was it more of a relaxing and atmospheric game? Probably. But even then, I hated the moment when I knew the solution in a short moment, but then the procedure took minutes to complete. It was frustrating at times. If you ever tried to learn a new keyboard layout like COLEMAN or DVORAK, you know the feeling I am talking about. It led me to walk around in a weird state where I was not able to enjoy the great environment I was in. I know the game's rooted in minimalism, but the game would be more enjoyable with a run button, or anything to solve the puzzle quicker. I just realized I did not even talk about the bosses. I guess they are as easy to forget as this game.

## Would I recommend it? 

Yes. No. Maybe? Even though my comments are mostly negative, this game can appeal to some people. Artisticly, Cocoon is amazing and its world deserves to be visited. The puzzle design is just not a good match with my brain (like DVORAK). If Limbo was a breath of fresh air, Cocoon is just as repetitive as breathing. I will be surprised if Stromae used Cocoon as an art reference for his next music video.
